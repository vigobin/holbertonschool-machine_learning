        bi_cell is an instance of BidirectinalCell that will be used
            for the forward propagation.
        X is the data to be used, given as a numpy.ndarray of shape
            (t, m, i).
        t is the maximum number of time steps.
        m is the batch size.
        i is the dimensionality of the data.
        h_0 is the initial hidden state in the forward direction,
            given as a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h).
        h is the dimensionality of the hidden state.
        h_t is the initial hidden state in the backward direction,
            given as a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h).

        H is a numpy.ndarray containing all of the concatenated hidden states.
        Y is a numpy.ndarray containing all of the outputs."""
