        state after a specified number of iterations
    P is a square 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n) representing the
        transition matrix.
    P[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from state i to state j.
    n is the number of states in the markov chain.
    s is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) representing the probability
        of starting in each state.
    t is the number of iterations that the markov chain has been through.
    Returns: a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) representing the probability of
        being in a specific state after t iterations, or None on failure."""
