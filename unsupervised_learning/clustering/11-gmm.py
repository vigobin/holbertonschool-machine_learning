    """Calculates a GMM from a dataset
    X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the dataset.
    k is the number of clusters.
    Returns: pi, m, S, clss, bic
    pi is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k,) containing the cluster priors.
    m is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d) containing the centroid means.
    S is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d, d) containing the covariance matrices.
    clss is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n,) containing the cluster indices
        for each data point.
    bic is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kmax - kmin + 1) containing the BIC value
        for each cluster size tested"""
